# Verify a Scoop Bucket Change

Use this gate after manifest work, including `scoop-add`, and before reporting a
change ready for review. Read the changed manifests and relevant workflow steps;
the local gate alone does not prove that a package installs on Windows.

## 1. Establish the scope

Inspect the diff against the intended base and identify changed package families,
including `-pipx` siblings, and shared scripts or workflows that affect installs.
Get the bucket identity from `origin` or an explicit repository override; never
copy this template's owner into another bucket. For an empty bucket, report that
there are no packages to install.

Read `references/verification-cases.md` when diagnosing failed verification or
checking noop bytes, archive paths, or placeholder behavior. It distinguishes
actual workflow failures from regression-derived examples.

## 2. Check the manifests

- Validate JSON syntax for affected manifests (for example,
  `python -m json.tool bucket/<package>.json`). Review metadata, dependencies,
  installer/uninstaller behavior, and every architecture. JSON syntax validation
  is not full Scoop schema validation.
- Keep `checkver` and `autoupdate` consistent with the concrete version and
  download URL. For binaries, verify the exact release asset and SHA-256, inspect
  the archive, and check `extract_dir` and `bin` relative to the extracted layout.
  Review version-dependent path templates as well as URL templates.
- Inspect top-level and architecture-specific hashes for 64 zeroes. A seeded
  binary is not installable until its actual asset/hash exists. Confirm the
  `Skip placeholder manifests` guard in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` covers it;
  do not install it or call a skipped CI install successful. Use the hash, not
  version `0.0.0`, to recognize placeholders.

### PyPI shims: verify all three noop values

Read `scripts/add_manifest.py` (`noop_source`) and `scripts/noop.ps1`. The
scaffolder derives its SHA-256 from local bytes with CRLF normalized to LF;
`.gitattributes` keeps the published file LF. To calculate the expected pair,
run from the repository root, replacing the repository and ref with the intended
values (the scaffolder's default ref is `main`):

```sh
python -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts"); from add_manifest import noop_source; print(noop_source("<owner>/<repository>", "<ref>"))'
```

Compare the result with each affected shim's concrete `url` and `hash`, including
its `-pipx` sibling. Check static `autoupdate.url` / `autoupdate.hash` too; PyPI
updates should change the version without switching the noop download.
Fetch the manifest's exact raw URL and hash the response bytes: a locally correct
hash cannot prove that the remote repository/ref serves the same file. Preserve
any Scoop filename fragment when reviewing the manifest, but exclude it from the
HTTP request. Report missing/unpublished remote content or mismatched bytes as a
blocker. Do not change the hash just to bless an unexplained remote mismatch.

## 3. Check the Windows smoke command

Inspect the `$smoke` map in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`. The default removes a
trailing `-pipx` from the package name and runs `<command> version`. Confirm the
actual installed executable name and upstream CLI syntax. If either differs,
add a package-keyed override, including a separate `-pipx` key when needed, using
a quick, noninteractive command that exits successfully. Review the workflow's
Scoop, uv, and pipx PATH setup; finding an executable in an archive does not prove
that the installed command is on PATH.

## 4. Run the local gate

```sh
mise install
mise run generate-readme
mise run check
```

Review the generated README diff. `check` runs unit tests, README freshness,
YAML/workflow linting, Cobo drift, and generated-agent freshness; it does not
download every manifest or perform a Windows install. Resolve failures according
to their source. For stale generated agent files, edit `.ai-rulez/` and run
`mise run agents:generate`. For Cobo drift, use the managed sync process instead
of manually editing `.gitignore`. Re-run the gate after fixes.

## 5. Decide and record Windows verification

Require a real Windows install and smoke test for a new installable package or
changes to download/hash, archive layout, dependencies, installer/uninstaller,
command exposure, or smoke/PATH logic. The `Tests` workflow can provide this
evidence: its Windows job copies working-tree manifests into a local bucket,
installs the package, and invokes its smoke command. Check results for the exact
head SHA and affected packages; an unrelated run or a skipped job is not evidence.
For a local Windows test, follow those same workflow steps so the working-tree
manifest is exercised rather than an old manifest from the remote bucket.

Metadata-only, removal-only, and skill-only changes normally need the local gate
without a new Windows install. For a seeded placeholder, record the intentional
install skip and require verification once a real release activates it. If
Windows evidence is needed but unavailable, mark it pending and report the change
as locally checked, with installability unverified. Triggering a remote workflow,
pushing, or opening a PR follows the user's approval rules.

## Report

Summarize the affected packages, local commands and results, URL/hash/layout and
noop checks, smoke command/overrides, and Windows evidence (run URL/head SHA or
local command results). List blockers and intentional skips explicitly. Keep
`passed`, `pending`, and `skipped` distinct so a maintainer knows what remains.

This skill bundles supporting files. Read them on demand when the task calls for them — don't bulk-load.
