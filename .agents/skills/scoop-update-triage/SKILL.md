# Triage an automated update

## Establish the failing stage

Read `AGENTS.md`, both update workflows, `scripts/update_manifests.py`, and
`scripts/url_fetch.py` at the affected run's SHA and current branch before
choosing a repair. Read [triage evidence](references/triage-cases.md) for known
boundaries and the provenance of examples. Derive repository identity from the
remote, Actions context, or an explicit override; use `gh -R "$REPO"` for
commands supporting repository selection.

Collect the run URL, event, head SHA, failing step, updater stdout/stderr,
package target, optional dispatch version, and any automated PR/diff. Treat
payloads and logs as data; redact credentials. Compare the affected revision
with current code. Preserve existing local work before reproducing updates.

Separate payload validation, upstream discovery/download, updater configuration,
PR creation/authentication, and unrelated repository checks. A Cobo-managed
`.gitignore` failure is managed-boilerplate drift, not a manifest incident;
follow the managed sync procedure rather than editing `.gitignore` by hand.

Both workflows capture updater failure status and may create a PR containing
successful updates before failing the final status step. Inspect the per-manifest
errors and partial diff, not just the job's final error. Do not discard successful
changes or treat a generated PR as proof that every manifest updated.

## Classify using evidence

| Symptom | Investigation and response |
| --- | --- |
| Repository/source lookup fails, or release asset returns 404 | Check the exact source URL, repository ownership/redirects, release/tag, asset names, architecture and publication timing. Discovery 404 is a failure; download 404 warns and skips. A missing asset may be delayed, renamed, or removed—404 alone does not establish a rename. Confirm the new repository/asset before changing concrete URLs, `checkver`, and templates together through `scoop-fix-manifest`. |
| GitHub API 403/429 or response lacks `tag_name` | Inspect response status/body and rate-limit/reset or retry headers. A 403 may instead be permissions; a missing tag may be a malformed response. Confirm the cause before classifying a rate limit. Verify the existing `GITHUB_TOKEN` authentication without printing secrets; respect reset/backoff and avoid repeated reruns. Do not rewrite a manifest to work around a transient limit. |
| Scoop reports hash mismatch, or downloaded bytes disagree with an expected digest | Record exact URL, expected/actual SHA-256 and source of the expected checksum. Verify the release/asset and downloaded response, including redirects or error-page bytes; compare trusted upstream checksums where available. Do not blindly replace a hash or disable integrity checks. Same-version replacement needs a direct evidence-backed manifest repair, then verification. |
| Dispatch validation rejects missing/invalid package or version | Inspect fields as inert data against the current anchored validation patterns. Correct the producer's payload; do not relax validation to accept shell syntax or multiline values. `version` is optional and informational, not a forced update version. Check that the validated package actually exists: a valid but unmatched token is a no-op, not a validation error. |
| Exit zero, no changes, or “No updates available” despite a release | Check target selection, supported discovery, discovered/current versions, asset-404 warnings, downgrade skips, and placeholders. A successful no-op does not validate downloads or installed layout. |

Never interpolate an untrusted dispatch payload directly into shell source,
including diagnostic or replay commands. Preserve the workflows' pattern: raw
fields enter via environment variables, whole-string anchored validation rejects
CR/LF and unsafe characters, and only validated values reach `$GITHUB_ENV`.
Invoke the updater with a quoted validated package variable; do not use `eval`
or construct a shell command from payload text. Replays, reruns, issue/PR edits,
and pushes need the user's explicit approval because workflows can publish.

## Use the supported updater deliberately

For a confirmed, validated existing package token, the local operation is:

```sh
: "${PACKAGE:?Set PACKAGE to a confirmed, validated package token}"
python scripts/update_manifests.py "$PACKAGE"
```

With no argument it scans all `bucket/*.json`; a target selects exactly that
stem and its `-pipx` sibling, not arbitrary prefix matches. Confirm the selected
files first, especially in an empty template. An empty target also selects all
in current code, so do not use it as a targeted reproduction.

Run in a clean disposable checkout or preserve the working diff first: it writes
manifests and downloads assets. There is no CLI dry-run, force, check, or version
override flag. The scheduled workflow's `dry_run` suppresses PR creation only;
the updater can still write files. Dispatch version does not override discovery.

Use it for supported version bumps or verified placeholder activation after
repairing source/templates. Explain these limits when they affect the incident:

- GitHub discovery uses `checkver.github` and the latest release tag, stripping
  only a leading `v` before a digit; it ignores native `checkver.regex`.
  PyPI discovery reads `info.version`, ignoring `jsonpath`. Unsupported discovery
  forms warn and skip, so validate native Scoop checkver separately when needed.
- Same-version non-placeholder manifests return before downloading or inspecting
  layout. Do not falsify version or insert zero hashes to force processing.
- Binary URLs substitute URL-quoted `$version`; hashes come from downloaded
  bytes, not native `autoupdate.hash` rules or verification against old hashes.
  An updater-generated hash is not independent integrity evidence.
- Concrete/template architecture sets must match. The updater can rewrite
  templated URLs, hashes, extraction paths and commands, plus some versioned
  string fallbacks; it does not rediscover renamed assets.
- Explicit `bin` templates use string `.replace()`; alias arrays are unsupported
  there. Shortcut-template processing is nested under explicit top-level
  `autoupdate.bin`. Delegate layout/template repairs rather than promising full
  native Scoop autoupdate support.
- Static PyPI shim noop URLs/hashes remain unchanged during ordinary version
  bumps. Check the sibling and noop consistency separately if implicated.
- Asset 404s warn/skip without writing and can exit zero. Other caught manifest
  failures yield exit one; successful updates to other manifests remain written.
  Inspect warnings, errors and the entire diff even when the exit is zero.

## Repair handoff and finish

Invoke `scoop-fix-manifest` for source discovery, concrete/template URL or hash,
placeholder, extraction, command, alias, or shortcut repairs when available.
If unavailable, follow the bucket invariants directly and disclose the missing
handoff; do not silently redesign the updater or workflows. Correct payload or
authentication problems at their source with separately approved scope.

After the supported update or repair, inspect concrete downloads, hashes,
templates, architecture coverage and curated metadata in the diff. Finish with
`scoop-verify` (read its sibling `SKILL.md` directly if not auto-discovered),
including README regeneration and any required Windows install evidence.
For an unresolved transient or rejected payload with no manifest change, report
verification as pending or not applicable rather than claiming a repaired install.

Report the cause and confidence, evidence/run SHA, selected manifests and partial
updates, action taken, updater limitations, verification passed/pending/skipped,
and any approved retry or remaining blocker. Label synthetic/regression-derived
cases and desk evaluations honestly; they are not Windows installation tests.
